# Specification Quality Checklist: Pet E-Commerce Site

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Tech stack details were explicitly provided by the user and recorded in the
  Assumptions section (not in requirements), satisfying the technology-agnostic rule.
- Shopping cart and payment processing are explicitly out of scope for this feature.
- Authentication mechanism (JWT vs session) deferred to plan phase — not a
  clarification blocker since Spring Security defaults are reasonable.
- All items pass. Ready to proceed to `/speckit-plan`.
